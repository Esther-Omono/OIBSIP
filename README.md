### L2-T3-To-Do-App
This is the third Level 2 task.
It is a to-do web app created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and Javascript for functionality.
This project makes use of the localStorage property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.
This means that the data stored from our to-do app persists even after the user closes the browser or restarts the computer.
